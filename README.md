# tcl_programs
Tcl is a string based scripting language. The source code is compiled into bytecode, which is later interpreted by the Tcl interpreter. It was created by John Osterhout in 1988. The language is commonly used for rapid prototyping, scripted applications, GUIs, and testing. The Tcl stands for tool command language, where the source code of a Tcl script consists of commands.
